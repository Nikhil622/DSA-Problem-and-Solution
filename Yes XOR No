class Solution {
  public:
    string yesXorNo(int N, long long A[], long long B[]) {
        return "Yes";
      }
};

Explanation: 

    The Primary Thing to observe in this problem is that,
    a xor b = c
    then a xor c= b
    Also, b xor c = a

    So If whenever we xor any element from Array A and Array B.
    If its result C is present in the array.....Then surely, we would encounter xoring of a with c...and surely its result will also be present in the array.
    That would make its count even for sure...Basically, Xors occurs in Pairs, always.

    If the result of xoring is not present in the array.THen we dont need to worry, as then we are not counting that pair.
    So, Answer will always be a Yes, irrespective of the input.
